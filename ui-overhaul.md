g# UI Overhaul Plan: Fun, Bouncy, and Tactile Interface

This plan outlines the steps to redesign the application's UI, focusing on a fun, bouncy aesthetic, exaggerated form elements, satisfying touch feedback, ample padding, and an overall "Wow" factor.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Design System

-   [x] **Define Color Palette:** Choose a primary palette that feels vibrant and fun, with sufficient contrast for accessibility. Define secondary and accent colors.
-   [x] **Select Typography:** Choose playful yet readable fonts for headings and body text. Ensure font weights and styles support the desired hierarchy.
-   [x] **Establish Spacing System:** Define consistent padding and margin values (e.g., using a base unit like 8px or 4px) to ensure adequate breathing room throughout the app. Document these as design tokens or CSS variables.
-   [x] **Choose Animation Approach:**
    -   [x] Select an animation library (e.g., Framer Motion for React/Next.js, GSAP) or decide on a pure CSS approach (transitions, keyframes).
    -   [x] Define core animation principles (e.g., spring physics for bounciness, duration, easing curves).
-   [x] **Base Styles & Reset:** Implement a CSS reset and define base styles for common HTML elements (body, headings, paragraphs, links) according to the new design system.

## Phase 2: Core Component Redesign

-   [x] **Buttons:**
    -   [x] Design base button styles (shape: rounded corners?, size, colors, typography).
    -   [x] Implement hover animation (e.g., slight scale up, subtle bounce).
    -   [x] Implement active/press animation (e.g., scale down/inward press effect, more pronounced bounce, shadow change for tactile feel).
    -   [x] Ensure clear visual distinction for different button types (primary, secondary, destructive).
-   [x] **Text Fields & Inputs:**
    -   [x] Design base styles: Consider larger size, bolder borders, or unique background/fill.
    -   [x] Implement "exaggerated" focus state: Animate border thickness/color, change background, add a subtle scale effect, or animate the label.
    -   [x] Ensure clear visual feedback for validation states (error, success).
    -   [x] Style placeholder text appropriately.
-   [x] **Other Form Elements (Dropdowns, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons):**
    -   [x] Redesign these elements to match the fun and tactile theme.
    -   [x] Apply custom styling, potentially replacing default browser appearances.
    -   [x] Add subtle animations on interaction (e.g., checkmark animation for checkboxes).
-   [x] **Cards / Containers:**
    -   [x] Apply consistent padding and rounded corners.
    -   [x] Consider subtle hover effects (lift/shadow increase).
    -   [x] Add entrance animations and layout transitions.

## Phase 3: Layout & Structure

-   [x] **Global Layout Review:** Analyze header, footer, navigation, and main content areas.
    -   [x] Create animated Header component with responsive navigation
    -   [x] Create Footer component with grid layout and social links
    -   [x] Update root layout with proper spacing and container
-   [x] **Apply Padding:** Ensure consistent padding defined in Phase 1 is applied to page layouts and containers.
    -   [x] Use CSS variables for spacing
    -   [x] Add container class with consistent padding
    -   [x] Update component spacing to use design system values
-   [x] **Refactor Layout:** Use modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid) with the `gap` property to manage spacing between elements effectively.
    -   [x] Create reusable grid components for common layouts
    -   [x] Implement flex utilities for alignment patterns
    -   [x] Use CSS Grid for complex layouts
-   [ ] **Responsiveness:** Ensure the layout and components adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.
    -   [ ] Implement mobile menu for navigation
    -   [ ] Add responsive variants for grid layouts
    -   [ ] Test and adjust component spacing on different devices

## Phase 4: Page-Specific Enhancements & "Wow" Factor

-   [ ] **Identify Key Views:** Determine which pages or user flows are most critical or would benefit most from extra polish.
-   [ ] **Micro-interactions:** Add subtle animations to elements like loading indicators, notifications, list item additions/removals, or icon interactions.
-   [ ] **Illustrations/Icons:** Incorporate custom illustrations or icons that align with the fun theme, if appropriate.
-   [ ] **Page Transitions:** Implement smooth and engaging animations for transitions between pages or views.
-   [ ] **Accessibility Review:** Double-check color contrast, keyboard navigability, focus management (especially with animations), and screen reader compatibility. Ensure animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Phase 5: Testing & Refinement

-   [ ] **Cross-Browser/Device Testing:** Test thoroughly on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and different device types (desktop, tablet, mobile).
-   [ ] **Performance Testing:** Profile animation performance. Ensure animations are smooth (ideally 60fps) and don't negatively impact application load times or responsiveness. Optimize animations (e.g., use `transform` and `opacity`).
-   [ ] **User Feedback (Optional):** If possible, gather feedback from users on the new design and interactions.
-   [ ] **Iteration:** Refine styles, animations, and interactions based on testing and feedback.

## Known Issues and Fixes (Added During Implementation)

- [x] Fixed CSS variable conflicts by changing `@theme inline` to standard `:root` declaration
- [x] Added proper imports for `springs` animation utilities in all component files
- [x] Fixed card width by adding `width: 100%` to card base styles
- [x] Adjusted container padding in layout.tsx to avoid double padding issues
- [x] Added proper spring animations to error states in Input component
- [x] Updated Card component to use proper CSS class names
